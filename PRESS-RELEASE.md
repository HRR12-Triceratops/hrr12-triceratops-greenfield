## Sub-Heading ##
  	Helping teams share and track information, so they can get t'Work.

## Summary ##
  	A one-stop shop for team collaboration; provides whiteboarding, chat, and task management to improve workflow for project groups.

## Problem ##
  	A lack of centralized communication can impede team progress, especially for groups collaborating remotely.

## Solution ##
  	t'Work integrates multiple collaborative tools to make it easier to work remotely on a project. The app provides a shared whiteboard with a color picker and clear board button, a task manager where you can keep tabs on your team's to-do list, and a chat so you can send messages and links to resources.
